# Volunteer Tracker - Independent Project
#### Ruby Database Basics for Epicodus, 1/10/20
#### By Celeste Renee Morton
## Description:
The concept for this project is to build an internal website for a non profit IT manager that would like to track volunteers working on projects using SQL for database queries. Each project should have many volunteers, but a volunteer can only work on one project at a time (a one-to-many relationship).
